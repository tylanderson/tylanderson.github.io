&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a major earthquake struck Haiti, causing widespread damage. Following the earthquake, a massive cholera outbreak occured. The first case was in October 2010, and by March 2011 ~4,500 people had already died as a result of cholera. Since 2010, ~9,750 people have died from cholera, and it has infected more than 800,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Haitian Cholera outbreak was the first modern outbreak of cholera. The first cases occured in Artibonite, Haiti&amp;rsquo;s largest department with an estimated population of 1.7 million people. The outbreak began in the Artibonite river, due to untreated sewage contaminating the river from a UN Peacekeeping Camp, which was set up to provide relief from the 2010 earthquake. As the river is a drinking source for many people, and due to Haiti&amp;rsquo;s poor drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, Cholera spread rapidly. Today Artibonite continues to be the department with the most Cholera cases in Haiti.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-methods&#34;&gt;Data &amp;amp; Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data for this project was retrived from publicly accessible and open-source sites. Most data came from the Humanitarian Data Excange (HDX), and Open Street Maps (OSM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Data&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Link&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OSM Roads&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Open Street Maps&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CNIGS Roads&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Centre National de l&amp;rsquo;Information GÃ©o-Spatiale&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/haiti-roads&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;WorldPop&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldpop.org.uk/data/summary/?id=172&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DEM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;STRM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprocessing:&lt;/strong&gt; The road network, due to being open sourced, had many flaws that need to be fixed. By extending the lines using editor in ArcGIS, and Planarizing the road features, a capable road dataset was built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merged OSM and CNIGS road datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend Lines Tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trim Lines Tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planarize Lines
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; After fixes, the road network for analysis was built using simple distance based cost, and service areas were generated for three intervals; 0km - 2km, 2km - 5km, and 5km - 8km. Cholera health sites within 5km was our target, being ~1 hour walking time, with 8km being on the outer fringes of health site accessibility. We chose to use distances as few people in Haiti own their own car, and rural areas have to walk to health sites. Additionally, previous research had looked at health sites within 5km euclidean distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Health Site Suitability:&lt;/strong&gt; Using suitability variables new health site suitability was calculated for areas outside of current service areas. The weighted overlay tool in ArcGIS was suitable for this. The weights were set as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Population: 35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance to Roads: 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance from Service Areas: 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slope: 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Hurricane Risk</title>
      <link>/project/hurricane-risk/</link>

&lt;p&gt;This project, produced out of an Advanced Vector class, examined how to quantify Hurricane Risk by county for Florida (as well as surrounding counties). Using Historical Hurricane data from NOAA, and Social Vulnerability data from the CDC, we mapped Exposure to hurricanes, Average Intensity of Hurricanes, and Vulnearbility. These were aggregated into a final, Hurricane Risk Index, or HRI. This can be used to assess the risk of each county to hurricane impacts. This is based off historical data, and may change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;


  




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/img/projects/hurricane-risk/HRI_Methods.jpg&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

Hurricane Risk Index is created using a multi-criteria evaluation with three parameters, a Social Vulnerability Index, a Hurricane Strike Index, and a Hurricane Wind Speed Index. These factors are based off the theory of disaster risk based off exposure, vulnerability, and intensity. All three varaibles were standardized from 0 - 1, and then combined using the HRI algrithm:
$$ HRI=\frac{(W{a}*SoVI)+(W{b}*HurrStrike)+(W{c}*AvgSpeed)}{W{a}+W{b}+W{c}} $$
Weights were set so that the hurricane data was not over represented: $W{a}=0.5$, $W{b}=0.25$, $W{c}=0.25$.



  




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/img/projects/hurricane-risk/HRI_Inputs.jpg&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

Individual HRI variables, and Hot Spot analysis for each. Hurricane based variables have a large hot spot in South Florida, while SoVI shows a hot spot of vulnerability just north of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hri-results&#34;&gt;HRI Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;


  




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/img/projects/hurricane-risk/HRI_Map.jpg&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

The Hurricane Risk Index product compares total risk of a county. This can account for areas that may have high risk in one category, but low risk in another. This index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 having no risk in each variable, and 1 having the highest risk in each variable. (Our HRI ranged from near 0 to 0.91).



  




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/img/projects/hurricane-risk/HRI_HotSpot_146080_Map.jpg&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

Running Hot Spot analysis on the HRI reveals that South Florida has the highest hurricane risk index, as well as a large hot spot of high HRI. This is the area most often struck by hurricanes, so it is important to know the risks in these areas. There is a cold spot just south of Jacksonville, which could indicate those communities are less at risk of hurricane damage. While the SoVI data we used came at county level, it would be very interesting to create a new SoVI index and use to at the town level to see more detail in HRI maps.&lt;/p&gt;
