      <description>For my senior honors thesis, I worked to update a Landsat forest cover map for Massachusetts to 2015. At Clark University forest cover maps for the state have been produced back to the 1970&amp;rsquo;s in ~10 year intervals based on data availability. Landsat 8 data for summer months of 2015 were used, with 15 images (3 per landsat scene) in total. CLASlite was used, a software produced by the Carnegie Institution for Science, which classifies raw imagery into fractional cover (soil, photosyntheic vegatation, and non-photosynthetic vegatation) and forest cover maps.</description>

      <description>This project created maps of the lands potential to transtion from Forest, Grassland, and Shrubland to Agriculture or Settlement. We used ESA CCI Land Cover Data, reclassified into 7 catagories, and TerrSett&amp;rsquo;s Land Change Modeler tool. This project used 9 explanatory variables, listed in the workflow below, and change analysis to determine the transition potential of each land cover type using the TerrSett MLP model.</description>

      <title>USVI Hurricane Water Quality</title>

      <description>The US Virgin Islands, located just East of Puerto Rico in the Carribean, consists of three main islands, St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas. In 2017, two major hurricanes, Irma and Maria, struck the islands, causing widespread damage. As part of the NASA DEVELOP project, we collabarated with the USVI Coastal Zone Management (CZM) to analyze the image of the hurricanes on water quality around reefs. Tourism is a huge sector in the USVI economy, and reefs are a vital part of that, so knowning the impact of major hurricanes such as Irma and Maria is vital.</description>
