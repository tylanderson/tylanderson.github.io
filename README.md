# Repository for my personal website

## About the site
This website was initally build as part of a class project. I initally got interested in building it after reading an article about building websites using blogdown, hugo, and r-studio. The initial website was build with blogdown and r-studio to allow for previewing of the site while prototyping. While occasioanlly using blogdown still, I have moved most of the developement into Atom, with only minor updates.

Updates are made infrequently, whenever I happen to get more time on my hands

## Hosting
This site is hosted on Netlify. Netlify has been great for testing updates to versioning of the theme as the deploy previews on the stage branch allow me to test for breaking changes when updating the theme.
