As part of a class at Clark University, I was part of a consultancy with the [Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)](https://www.wcs.org/our-work/species/bison) on rangeland trends in Montana and the implications for Bison reintroduction, particularly for partners. Bison are a ecologically important species in the rangeland across the Western US, and remain a vital part of WCS's mission. In particular WCS was interested in who they should partner with across Montana and within the Crown of the Continent ecoregion.

## Research Objectives

***Where and with whom should WCS build partnerships to successfully reintroduce bison to Montana?***

  1. Where is potential bison habitat in Montana?
  2. What are the trends in bison habitat vegetation conditions between 2004-2018? Where are these trends occurring?
  3. What are the relationships between management unit size and ownership?
    * Federal, state, tribal, private ownerships

#### Habitat Modeling

#### Land Ownership
As ownership's effect on suitable rangeland for bison was such a concern, we used the Montana State Cadastral database to understand how land was allocated in ownership classes across the state. We broke ownership down broadly into 4 groups: private, state, federal, and tribal lands. As seen below in Figure 2, Over half of suitable lands for bison are under private ownership, with federal lands being the next biggest owner.
