I am a Remote Sensing Scientist at Cloud to Street. Currently working on deploying remotely sensed flood maps and analytics to enable people around the world to respond to floods.

Previously at Clark University focused on land use/land cover change, forest disturbances, and coastal ecology. My thesis there focused on using the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 product for Gypsy Moth defoliation tracking.
